# BaseLine-wander-removal-fromECG-signals
 ECGs are vital for monitoring heart health, but their accuracy can be compromised by noise. This project focuses on developing discrete-time IIR filters to effectively suppress baseline wander and powerline interference in ECG signals. These filters will help ensure accurate ECG interpretation and timely detection of cardiac abnormalities. 

## Methodolgy:
#### Understanding the ECG signals

ECG signals originate from the heart's electrical activity, primarily from the sinoatrial (SA) node, which initiates heart muscle depolarization and repolarization.

*Typical CharacteristicsðŸ¥‡*
1. Amplitude: 0.5 to 2 mV
2. QRS Complex Duration: 80 to 120 ms
3. Heart Rate: 60 to 100 beats per minute
#### Common Sources of Noise:

1. *Baseline Wander:* Low-frequency noise caused by respiration, body movements, and electrode variations.
2. *Powerline Interference:* Noise above 50/60 Hz originating from electrical sources.
3. *EMG Noise:* High-frequency noise from muscle contractions, often overlapping with ECG frequencies.
#### Noise Suppression Techniques:
The project explores four IIR filter design methods:
1. Butterworth
2. Chebyshev Type I
3. Chebyshev Type II
4. Elliptic (Equiripple)
#### Bandpass Requirements:
1. Stopband: 0 Hz to 1 Hz with â‰¥ 40 dB attenuation.
2. Passband: 6 Hz to 40 Hz with â‰¤ 1 dB ripple.
3. Stopband: Frequencies above 45 Hz with â‰¥ 40 dB attenuation.
