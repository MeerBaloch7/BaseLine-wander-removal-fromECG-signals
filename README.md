# BaseLine-wander-removal-fromECG-signals
 ECGs are vital for monitoring heart health, but their accuracy can be compromised by noise. This project focuses on developing discrete-time IIR filters to effectively suppress baseline wander and powerline interference in ECG signals. These filters will help ensure accurate ECG interpretation and timely detection of cardiac abnormalities.
